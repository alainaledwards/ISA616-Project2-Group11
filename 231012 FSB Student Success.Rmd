## Business Value Proposition

![](BVP - Student Sucess.png)

1.  Define the client or audience for your data analysis solution.

-   Our client for this project is Kirk Bogard, Associate Vice President
    for Development and External Relations in FSB.

2.  Define the client jobs. What jobs are your clients trying to get
    done. Use a separate bullet point for each job you intend to help
    your client get done.

-   Inform FSB rankings
-   Make case for admission (showing parents and students the placement
    reults through percentages and salary levels)
-   Attracting other companies to recruit from FSB
-   FSB Brand Management -- evidence to support claims made
-   Show which majors have the best / worst placement results in terms
    of percentages
-   Show which majors have best / worst placement results in terms of
    salary levels

3.  Add pains. What are the pains before, during, and after your client
    is trying to get their jobs done? Create a bullet point for every
    specific pain.

-   Before:
    -   Client stated students not filling out survey to get information
        was a pain.
-   During:
    -   Inputation errors -- missing variables (average salaries:
        student adding salary to survey vs external relations have to
        find salary online)
-   After:
    -   Not having enough support and evidence to back up brand
        management claims (Top 10 ranking for ROI)
    -   Lacking information to best recruit prospective students into
        certain FSB programs

4.  Describe your intended solution. Give a bullet point for each major
    element of your product or solution.

-   Our intended solution is a dashboard showing statistics with FSB
    majors best / worst placements, specifically percentages and salary
    levels.
-   Using Student Success data from 2019-2021
-   Missing data will be filled in (missing salaries)
-   Give statistics to be used in marketing that will be appealing to
    future prospective students about FSB majors

5.  What are the pain killers from your solution? You should be able to
    map a pain killer to a client pain.

-   Using national averages and public data to input missing salary
    values -- external relations won't have to spend time searching for
    missing data
-   Improve prospective student recruitment -- find data to use in
    marketing based on the specific majors
-   Using salary statistics to back up our Top 10 ranking for ROI claim
-   Having the data avaliable to support any other brand management
    claims

6.  Add gains. What else might your solution deliver that will surprise
    or benefit your client above and beyond simply killing their pain?

-   Guide future marketing programs -- finding more data to support
    future rankings or statistics
-   Strengthen relationships with companies who currently recruit out of
    FSB -- proving our continued success to encourage companies to keep
    returning to Miami career fairs, etc.
-   Evidence to show Covid year didn't affect students post-grad
    placements

7.  What are the gain creators? You should be able to map a gain creator
    to a client gain.

-   Student salary and major statistics guiding brand management and
    marketing
-   Generating compelling statistics to best market to prospective
    student and parents based on major focus
-   Learning about FSB strengths through exploring Covid data -- data
    didn't change through this year
-   We can use this internally to learn what recruiting works best -
    Helps strengthen company relationships and show to prospective
    students that even during Covid FSB students were still placing well
    in terms of percentages and salary levels

## Project Overview

Annually, the FSB conducts a senior survey of graduates to learn of
their employment status. In addition, information is verified using
LinkedIn and employer survey information. The data you are provided
('FSB_BI_Survey_2019_2021.rds') contains data on graduates for 2019,
2020, and 2021. The data are merged from two sources: the senior survey,
and data from the Miami University database.

The data are anonymized, however it is possible that if you look hard
enough, you can identify students. You are bound, ethically not to do
so. It is a strict ethical code that you will not discuss individual
data points with ANYONE except for me and your team. Failure to comply
with this code of ethics will result in a failing grade in the course.

## Data Sources

You have three years of data representing FSB graduates, including
graduates in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The dataset provided had 42
variables. The source is either derived by me during data
cleaning/merging, from the Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise
Edition (OBIEE) maintained by Miami adminsitration, or from the self
reported senior survey. I have cleaned and merged the files into one
file.

## Remove Unnecessary Columns
We removed the following variables from our dataframe, as they did not add value for our question or were not needed:
BBRJ 
Business Direct Admit: 
Combined Bacc and Masters 
Dean's List 
FSB Scholars 
Study Abroad Courtesy Account
President's List 
Transfer Work (Pre-Banner) 
Cum Laude 
Magna Cum Laude
Summa Cum Laude 
University Honors 
UniversityHonors w/Distinction 
minor2--chose to focus only on primary minor
latin_honors 
survey_city 
survey_company 
survey_pref_field
survey_pref_loc 
survey_state 
nmajor --only using major1
major2--chose to focus on primary major
Term.Code--using year instead

```{r}
# Remove unnecessary columns

data <- data %>%
  select(-`BBRJ`, -`Business Direct Admit`, -`Combined Bacc and Masters`, -`Combined Bacc and Masters`, -`Dean's List`, -`FSB Scholars`, -`Study Abroad Courtesy Account`, -`President's List`, -`Transfer Work (Pre-Banner)`,
 -`Cum Laude`, -`Magna Cum Laude`, -`Summa Cum Laude`, -`University Honors`, -`UniversityHonors w/Distinction`, -`minor2`, -`latin_honors`, -`survey_city`, -`survey_company`, -`survey_pref_field`, -`survey_pref_loc`, -`survey_state`, -`nmajor`, -`major2`, -`Term.Code`)
```

## Explore Missing Data

The graph we created illustrates the variables with missing data. From this we were able to determine what variables needed attention to fix the missing data. Using the graph, we determined to remove three of the variables that were missing >50% of the data and wouldn't add any value to creating our solution.

```{r}

missing_counts <- sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# Create a data frame for visualization
missing_data_df <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(data),
  MissingCount = missing_counts
)

# Sort the data frame by missing counts
missing_data_df <- missing_data_df[order(-missing_data_df$MissingCount), ]
missing_data_df <- subset(missing_data_df, MissingCount > 0)
missing_data_df


# Create a bar chart using ggplot2
ggplot(missing_data_df, aes(x = Variable, y = MissingCount)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Missing Data Bar Chart",
    x = "Variable",
    y = "Missing Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 

## save image
ggsave("missing_data_df.pdf")
write_csv(missing_data_df,"missing_data_df.csv")
```

## Handle Missing Variables
The following variables were dropped:
survey_gradprogram, survey_gradschool,survey_deptfunc as each had over 3000 missing values out of 3235. We determined this from our graph above.  

Survey_internships had multiple values that were missing, but we noticed that some were incorrect.  Students had internships listed, but this column was empty. To fix this we computed if the student listed an internship under the four internship columns, this column would count that to fill in. (MUST DO)

We imputed intern one,two,three,four as N/A if there were missing values as most students didn't have four different internships.
We imputed survey_offers as 0 if it was missing as we assumed they received zero offers.
Finally, we also imputed survey_plans to N/A when it was missing values.

Since our problem concerns salary, we had to find a way to fix the over 50% missing values.  First, we tried to impute mean, but realized this wouldn't work with over 1500 missing values.  Ultimately, we decided to drop all the rows that didn't give us a salary as this was the best solution we came up with.

```{r}
## drop gradschool, grad_program, deptfunc large counts of missing variables
data <- data %>%
  select(-`survey_gradprogram`, -`survey_gradschool` , -`survey_deptfunc`)


#calculate missing values for survey_internships
data$survey_internships <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_internships), 0, data$survey_internships)

#Potential Code to fix survey_internship instead of the above code
#data$survey_internships <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_internships) & !is.na(data$survey_internfour), 4, NA)
#data$survey_internships <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_internships) & !is.na(data$survey_internthree), 3, NA)
#data$survey_internships <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_internships) & !is.na(data$survey_interntwo), 2, NA)
#data$survey_internships <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_internships) & !is.na(data$survey_internone), 1, 0)

## impute missing for intern1,2,3,4 to "N/A"
data$survey_internone <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_internone), "N/A", data$survey_internone)
data$survey_interntwo <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_interntwo), "N/A", data$survey_interntwo)
data$survey_internthree <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_internthree), "N/A", data$survey_internthree)
data$survey_internfour <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_internfour), "N/A", data$survey_internfour)

data$survey_offers <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_offers), 0, data$survey_offers)

data$survey_plans <- ifelse(is.na(data$survey_plans), "N/A", data$survey_plans)

data <- data[complete.cases(data$survey_salary), ]

```

## Rename Columns

We renamed our 16 variables we kept to have the same name formatting allowing easier readability.

Our current variables with the renamed columns are:

1. Major: text, OBIEE, first major
2. FirstGen: binary, OBIEE, first generation student status
3. Honors: binary, OBIEE, member of University honors program
4. Minor: text, OBIEE, first listed minor
5. RaceEthnicity: text, OBIEE, race/ethnicity
6. Gender: text, OBIEE, sex
7. GPARange: text, OBIEE, GPA within a .5 range
8. Year: text, derived, first four digits of Term.Code stored as a
    character variable
9. InternFour: text, survey, student reported fourth internship
    they held during college
10. InternThree: text, survey, student reported third internship
    they held during college
11. InternTwo: text, survey, student reported second internship
    they held during college
12. InternOne: text, survey, student reported first internship
    they held during college
13. InternshipCount: text, survey, Student reported number of
    internships they held during college
14. OfferCount: text, survey, student reported number of offers for
    full time employment received
15. Plans: text, survey, student reported plans after graduation
16. Salary: numeric, survey, student reported salary
```{r}
# Rename columns for clarity
data <- data %>%
  rename(Major = major1, Minor = minor1, RaceEthnicity = IPEDS.Race.Ethnicity, Year = year.x, GPARange= GPA.Range, InternFour = survey_internfour, InternThree = survey_internthree, InternTwo = survey_interntwo, InternOne = survey_internone, InternshipCount = survey_internships, OfferCount = survey_offers, Plans = survey_plans, Salary = survey_salary, Honors = `Honors Program`, FirstGen = `First Generation College Stdnt`)
```

```{r}
major_abbreviations <- data.frame(
  Major = c("Finance", "Marketing", "Accountancy", "Management and Leadership",
            "Human Capital Mgmt& Leadership", "Business Economics", 
            "Information Systems", "Supply Chain & Operations Mgmt", 
            "Business Analytics", "Entrepreneurship"),
  MajorAbbr = c("FIN", "MKT", "ACC", "MGT", "HCML", "ECON", "IS", "SCOM", "BA", "ESP"))
  
data <- data %>%
  left_join(major_abbreviations, by = "Major")
```

```{r}
data <- data[!is.na(as.integer(data$OfferCount)), ]

```


```{r}
knitr::kable(data[1:5, ], "pipe")
```

## Reorder Columns

We reordered the columns in a more logical sense, allowing the intern 1,2,3,4 to now be in order beginning with plans and internshipCount.

```{r}

data <- data %>%
  select(MajorAbbr, Major, Minor, Honors, GPARange, Gender, RaceEthnicity, FirstGen, Year, Plans, InternshipCount, InternOne, InternTwo, InternThree, InternFour, OfferCount, Salary)

```

## Verify Cleaned Data, Export as cleaned CSV file

Finally, we were able to verify our cleaned data and exported it to a CSV file ready for the next step.

```{r}
saveRDS(data, "cleaned_FSB_Student_Success")
knitr::kable(data[1:5, ], "pipe")
```
